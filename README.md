# Nerfstudio Wire Implementation (working repo)

Implementing WIRE: Wavelet Implicit Neural Representations (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05187) using the NeRFStudio Repo (https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio  | version accessed 06/Feb/2023) as a pipeline).

The model structure can be found in Appendix A.5 of the WIRE paper.

Will create a pull request with NS repo if results from WIRE INR implementation is successful.
